## üî¨üî¨ Current Projects

### üéØüß† Educational Keylogger
A keylogger developed in Python as part of my red team learning path. It logs all user keystrokes, tracks active window changes, and sends the data to a webhook ‚Äî **strictly for educational and ethical purposes**.

‚úÖ Detects active window titles  
‚úÖ Interprets special keys like [COPY], [PASTE], [ENTER], etc.  
‚úÖ Sends logs after a certain threshold (e.g. 200 characters)  
‚úÖ Clean and commented code, easy to understand  
‚úÖ Useful to understand how keylogging and data exfiltration work
